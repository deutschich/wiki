## How does this Pack work for Java & Bedrock

I create this Pack mainly for Java but I have found a Java 2 Bedrock Pack converter and I'm using this. If you want to add textures, you only have to add them to the Java Pack with a Pull Request. More Information for that can be found at [Contributing](contributing).
