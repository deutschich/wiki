# About CheapDesign
CheapDesign (Old Name *CheapMC*) is a **Minecraft Resource Pack** which changes textures to **Cheap Looking Textures**, which makes the game looking very cheap, like on some *very cheap online shops*. The Project is maintained by deutschich (aka. User404_, MineMeeer, MineMeer). Everyone can contribute to the project (More details at [Contributing](contributing.md))

# Why there are not that much Updates?

I don't have that much time to design everytime for this Plugin because I have "*too much hobbies*". If I have time for CheapDesign, I'm working on Updates. More Information for coming Updates can be found at [Roadmap](roadmap)
